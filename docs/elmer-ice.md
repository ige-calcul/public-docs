Elmer/Ice is an Open Source Finite Element Software for Ice Sheet, Glaciers and Ice Flow Modelling

Elmer/Ice is a full-Stokes, finite element, ice sheet / ice flow model. The aim of this website is to present the capabilities of Elmer/Ice and to distribute course materials and tutorials.
Elmer/Ice is an add-on package to Elmer, which is a multi-physics FEM suite mainly developed by CSC-IT Center for Science Ltd., Espoo, Finland. Initially started by CSC,  IGE and ILTS, currently multiple institutions and individuals contribute to the development of Elmer/Ice.
Elmer/Ice is an open-source code based on the finite element method for modeling the flow of ice, glaciers and polar ice caps. 
Elmer/Ice is based on the numerical core of the [Elmer multiphysics finite element code](https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/), mainly developed at the CSC - IT Center for Science - in Espoo, Finland. 
Elmer/Ice is a set of tools dedicated to problem-solving in glaciology. These tools are of various kinds: firstly, specific developments are added to the Elmer code on particular aspects of glacier flow (rheological laws of ice, friction laws, asymptotic thin-layer equations, inverse methods, etc.); secondly, configurations and examples are provided to deal with a wide range of problems; thirdly, the user community is supported by a [website](http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/) , a [documentation wiki](http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php)  , and the organization of [beginners' courses and user workshops]([http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=courses:courses)
Elmer/Ice was labeled in 2020  by  a specialized commission of Ocean and Atmosphere [CSOA](https://www.insu.cnrs.fr/en/person/specialized-commission-ocean-atmosphere-csoa)  for 5 years. This label was renewed for 2025-2029
