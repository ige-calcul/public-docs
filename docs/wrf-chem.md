## Material from the IGE WRF and WRF-Chem 2024 training workshop

The code and instructions for running either WRF or WRF-Chem with a specific setup are provided [here](https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-Chem-training).
The training workshop provided participants with a hands-on introduction to running the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its chemistry extension, WRF-Chem, on the GridCad (Dahu) cluster. The documentation from the workshop provides the details of the technical setup, how to run simulations for a specific case (with specific options), and analyzing outputs. This material can be used as a step-by-step guide for future model users to follow.

In the training material, exercise 1 focuses on WRF and exercise 2 focuses on WRF-Chem.
