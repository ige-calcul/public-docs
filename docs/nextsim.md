# neXtSIM : the next generation Sea Ice Model

The neXt generation Sea Ice Model (neXtSIM) is a Lagrangian dynamical-thermodynamical sea-ice model that faithfully represents large-scale sea ice thickness, concentration and drift patterns,
statistical properties of pack ice deformation and drift, diffusion and dispersion; and additionally exhibits a strong capacity for short-term sea ice forecasting at Pan-Arctic scales.

neXtSIM was developed to explore the role of sea-ice mechanics and dynamics in determining the large-scale behaviour of Arctic sea ice. 
As such, it has served as a testing and development ground for the brittle sea-ice rheologies developed over the past decade.
