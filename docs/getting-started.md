# Getting started

Welcome to IGE !

Here you can find useful informations about how we make scientific analysis and ressources to get you up to speed with your fellow colleagues.

 - First, we are using mostly Linux and Mac distributions, so a prerequisiste is to know the basics Unix Shell commands, if it is not your case, have a look at this [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

 - Then, a nice way to back-up and access your work (scripts, notebooks, text files, etc ...) from anywhere is to create a [github account](https://github.com/) and to synchronize your work there. Learn how to do it [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/git-github.md)
 
 - If you are working with python, we recommend that you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your librairies via environments. Learn how to do it [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/conda.md)
 
 - Also a nice way to have the code you write and the plots you produce at the same place, along with some texts, equations and/or pictures is to use [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Learn how to install and use it [here](jupyter.md)

 - Next, you may want to access some remote computers in order to have more ressources than on your personnal laptop or to access some datasets, you have several options :
    - the lab servers ige-calcX allows you to access some CPUs and GPUs. Learn how to access and use it [here](https://ige-calcul.github.io/public-docs/docs/clusters/Ige/ige-calcul1.html#)
    - the Grenoble meso computing center [GRICAD](https://gricad.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) for bigger computations. Learn how to compute there [here](https://ige-calcul.github.io/public-docs/docs/clusters/Gricad/dahu.html#)
    - the national supercomputers located at [IDRIS](http://www.idris.fr/), [CINES](https://www.cines.fr/) or [TGCC](https://www-hpc.cea.fr/fr/complexe/tgcc-JoliotCurie.htm) for even bigger computations [tutorials to come soon]
  
A list of useful softwares and how to learn about them is available [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/software.md)
