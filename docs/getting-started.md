# Getting started

Welcome to IGE!

Here you can find useful information about how we conduct scientific analysis, and ressources to get you up to speed with your fellow colleagues.

 - We generally use GNU/Linux and MacOS distributions, so a prerequisiste is to know basic Unix Shell commands. If it is not your case, have a look at this [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

 - If you use a mainstream GNU/Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Fedora, you can install most of the basic scientific software you may need (such as the NetCDF libraries) via the system's package manager (`apt-get`, `dns`, etc.). If you are on MacOS, [brew](https://brew.sh/) is a good way to manage this task.

 - A quick way to back-up and access your work (scripts, notebooks, text files, etc.) from anywhere is to create a [github account](https://github.com/) and to synchronize your work there. Learn how to do it [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/git-github.md).

 - If you work with Python, we recommend that you use [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) (a seamless/drop-in replacement for [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) to manage your librairies via environments. Learn how to do it [here](clusters/Tools/micromamba.md).

 - Some like to use [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to have code and corresponding plots in the same document, along with some text, equations and/or pictures. Learn how to install and use them [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)

 - You may want to access some remote computers in order to have more ressources than on your personnal laptop, or to access specific datasets. For this you have several options:
    - The lab servers ige-calcX allow you to access some CPUs and GPUs. Learn how to access and use them [here](clusters/Ige/ige-calcul1.md).
    - The Grenoble meso computing center [GRICAD](https://gricad.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) for bigger computations. Learn how to use this resource [here](clusters/Gricad/dahu.md).
    - The national supercomputers located at [IDRIS](http://www.idris.fr/), [CINES](https://www.cines.fr/) or [CEA](https://www-hpc.cea.fr/fr/complexe/tgcc-JoliotCurie.htm) for even bigger computations [tutorials to come soon].

A list of commonly-used software and links to useful resources is available [here](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/software.md).
