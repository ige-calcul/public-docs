### MPMD with MPI
This short tutorial shows how to run different executables simultaneously (MPMD mode) with MPI. It also aims to
demonstrate that MPI can be used to exchange data across different programs. This is useful, for example, when coupling
an ocean model and an atmosphere model that are being developped separately.
