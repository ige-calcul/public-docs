# Awesome IGE Calcul

What is an Awesome List? Awesome lists are among the most popular repositories on GitHub. The main idea is simple: to gather as many wonderful and relevant resources as possible relating to a theme.
Their structure is extremely simple: a list of links, each potentially described by a single line and possibly arranged by category.
> The most meta example, an awesome list... of awesome lists: https://awesome.re (3rd most starred :star: repo on GitHub)
