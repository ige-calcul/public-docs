# NEMO a Community Ocean Model

The "Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean" (NEMO) is a state-of-the-art modelling framework. It is used for research activities and forecasting services in ocean and climate sciences. NEMO is developed by a European consortium with the objective of ensuring long term reliability and sustainability.

The NEMO ocean model has 3 major components:

  - NEMO-OCE models the ocean {thermo}dynamics and solves the primitive equations
  - NEMO-ICE models sea-ice {thermo}dynamics, brine inclusions and subgrid-scale thickness variations
  - NEMO-TOP-PISCES models the {on,off}line oceanic tracers transport and biogeochemical processes
