Here are the events that can be interesting for the platform members

Ongoing:

1. OpenReproLab
 [OpenReproLab](./openreprolab.md) is a support provided by IGE Calcul to M2 students. The aim is to pool the IGE's best practices around computation, and to put into practice the ideas of Open science and Reproducible research. Students and supervisors are therefore invited to take part in this initiative to co-construct tomorrow's research.
