# Computing for IGE users exclusively

To get used to cluster and specially if you want to run matlab or other program without any time limit, you can have access to IGE cluster, which was set up for that

The following documentation will get you through the different steps you need to know to start computing immedialtely

# Computing for IGE/External users

Gricad infrastructure provides a lot of ressources for all the labs of Grenoble University. It includes CPU/GPU ressources

For now the most used cluster is dahu which is used for CPU ressources

Gricad is open for any student/researcher/engineer. If you have a contract with Grenoble University, you have already an internal account defined by Agalan Credentials. If you are outside the campus and even outside France, you will get an external account as long as you have an institutianal email

@Ige, we are a providing a straighforward documentation , to start computing rapidly

You can also have a look to a more detailed documentation from Gricad

As for GPU ressources and IA computing  , there is another cluster named bigfoot.
