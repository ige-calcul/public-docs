## Computing ressources documentation



# Compution for IGE users exclusively

To get used to cluster and specially if you want to run matlab or other program without any time limit, you can have access to IGE cluster, which was set up for that

The following documentation will get you through the different steps you need to now to start computing immedialtely

# Compution for IGE/External users

Gricad infrastructure provides a lot of ressources for all the labs of Grenoble University. It includes CPU/GPU ressources
For now the most used cluster is dahu which is used for CPU ressources

@ige, we are a proving a straighforward documention , to start computin rapidly

you can also have a look to a more detailed documentation from Gricad

As for GPU ressources and IA computing  , there is another cluster named bigfoot.
