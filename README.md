# Computing for IGE users exclusively

If you need fast access to a small computing ressources or if you want to run matlab or other programs without any time limits, you can have access to IGE cluster, which was set up for that
The following documentation will guide you through the different steps you need to know to start computing immedialtely

# Computing for IGE/External users

Gricad infrastructure provides a lot of ressources for all the labs of Grenoble University. It includes CPU/GPU ressources

For now the most used cluster is dahu which is used for CPU ressources

Gricad is open for any student/researcher/engineer. If you have a contract with Grenoble University, you have already an internal account defined by Agalan Credentials. If you are outside the campus and even outside France, you will get an external account as long as you have an institutianal email
For both cases you will need to log in to a special interface and create an account anyway to join a project (more details follow)

@Ige, we are a providing a straighforward documentation , to start computing rapidly

You can also have a look to a more detailed documentation from Gricad

As for GPU ressources and IA computing  , there is another cluster named bigfoot.
